description: |
  collectd is a small daemon which collects system information
  periodically and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values
  in a variety of ways. Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every
  time it wants to update the values it's very fast and easy on the 
  system. Also, the statistics are very fine grained since the files are 
  updated every 10 seconds by default.  The collected information can be
  used to find current performance bottlenecks (performance analysis)
  and predict future system load (capacity planning).
  This charm was initially developed and maintained by Prometheus Charmers.
